This is a fork of YUICompressor.Net

It contains the following changes:
* signed package
* build with appveyor [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/t41f7p9o4gi7c5q4?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tomap/yuicompressor-net)
* only YUICompressor is available (MSBuild, NAnt & Web.Optimization are not compiled, but PR and you will be answered)
* .Net 4.5


##Project Description
This is a .NET port of the Yahoo! UI Library's YUI Compressor Java project. The objective of this project is to compress any Javascript and Cascading Style Sheets to an efficient level that works exactly as the original source, before it was minified.

![CI Status via AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ttirf8q8kpm89a2v) ![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/yuicompressor.net.svg?syle=flat-square)

##Main Features

- Compress and/or Bundle Javascript and/or Cascading StyleSheets.
- 1 source file -> 1 destination file (that's just compression)
- Multiple source files -> 1 destination file (compression and bundling)
- Multiple source files -> multiple destination files (so you're pro at this now?!)
- Optional MSBuild Tasks, NAnt Tasks and MVC4 BundleTransform.

##Referenced Version
Based on YUI Compressor version: 2.4.4 (last checked at 2011-01-17).

##How close to the Java Port?
Pretty damn close, now :) *Same unit tests (which pass)*.
The only thing I haven't been able to do is get the exact same obfuscation because the java code is using a hashtable instead of a sorted hashtable/dictionary. It's identical besides that (and works the same). Just visually look different but is exactly the same file size, etc.
